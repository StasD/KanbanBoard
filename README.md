# Kanban Board Demo

This is the project to showcase a full stack web application which uses [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/overview?view=aspnetcore-9.0) with [EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) for Web API backend, [React](https://react.dev), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com), [HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com) component library, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for client app, [nginx](https://nginx.org) as the web server and reverse proxy, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as the database.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v24 was used during development)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with ESLint and C# Dev Kit extensions (for development)

## Building and running

1) Use git to clone this repository or download a zip file and unpack it to a folder on your local machine.
2) Come up with a password for PostgreSQL database user. Then in folders ``data/pg`` and ``KanbanBoardApi``, rename files ``.env.example`` into ``.env`` (or make copies with that name) and replace ``<pg_password>`` with the password you came up with.
3) Navigate to the folder with the source code in the terminal (on Windows, use Git Bash), and execute ``build_all.sh`` file located at the root of that folder:

    ```sh
    ./build_all.sh
    ```

    This shoud build both backend and frontend apps and start docker servers using docker compose. Then just open [https://localhost](https://localhost) to access the application.

Notes:

- To add ssl certificate used by the app to your machine's trust chain, navigate to the ``data/ssl`` folder in the terminal, and run ``openssl pkcs12 -export -out server.pfx -inkey server.key -in server.crt``. Then double click the newly created ``server.pfx`` file and follow prompts to add its certificate to your os' keychain. Alternatively, you can just trust the certificate in your browser after being prompted.

- Docker will use ports 443, 5032, 7003, 8180, 8125 on your localhost. If any of these are already used by other applications running on your machine, please adjust ports in docker-compose.yml.

- Authentication is not fully implemented yet.
